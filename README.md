# Project Title: Hyper-spectral Image Segmentation of Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (2022)

Project Description:
In this project, we developed a cutting-edge machine learning model employing Wavelet Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to address the challenging task of segmenting Hyper-spectral Images associated with Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma. The primary objectives of our endeavor were to enhance the accuracy of medical image analysis and contribute to the advancement of cancer diagnosis and treatment.

Our comprehensive approach encompassed several key components:

Data Collection: We curated a meticulously annotated dataset of Hyper-spectral Images specifically tailored to the context of Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma. This step was pivotal in ensuring that our model would have access to a diverse range of clinical cases, thereby promoting robust and generalizable segmentation.

Data Preprocessing: To facilitate effective model training, we invested significant effort in data preprocessing. This involved tasks such as noise reduction, data augmentation, and the transformation of multi-spectral information into a format conducive to deep learning.

Memory Optimization: Recognizing the computational challenges posed by Hyper-spectral Images, we implemented code optimizations to enhance memory management. This not only made our model more efficient but also enabled it to process large datasets with relative ease.

Model Development: Our core innovation lay in the development of a specialized Wavelet CNN architecture. This architecture was tailored to exploit both spatial and spectral features within the Hyper-spectral Images, capitalizing on the unique characteristics of this data type.

Evaluation and Results: The efficacy of our model was rigorously evaluated, with a focus on accuracy in image segmentation. We achieved a remarkable Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 0.74 when tested on previously unseen images. Our model demonstrated the ability to classify images into three distinct classes, a vital capability for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning.

In summary, our project represents a significant step forward in the domain of medical image analysis, specifically in the context of Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma. By harnessing the power of Wavelet CNNs and optimizing every aspect of our workflow, we have produced a robust and accurate segmentation tool that holds great promise for enhancing the diagnosis and treatment of this critical medical condition.
