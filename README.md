## üìå Project Overview  

![Project](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1SQRjCQ_7sv6NOq8FN4l8tBPKdOHvGElB)

This project focuses on **segmentation of hyperspectral images (HSI)** of **head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)** surgical specimens. Accurate cancer margin detection during surgery is critical to ensure complete tumor removal and improve patient outcomes.  

We designed and implemented a **Wavelet Convolutional Neural Network (Wavelet CNN)**, trained on **hyperspectral imaging data from 100+ patient surgical specimens**, leveraging both **spectral** and **spatial features**. The model was deployed and trained on an **HPC cluster** to handle large-scale, memory-intensive datasets.

## üéØ Objective & Outcome  

- **Objective:**  
  To develop a deep learning pipeline capable of segmenting hyperspectral surgical specimen images of HNSCC, enabling accurate tumor margin detection for clinical use.  

- **Outcome:**  
  - Implemented a **Wavelet CNN** trained on **7,000+ hyperspectral images** from 100+ patients.  
  - Optimized **memory management and preprocessing pipelines** for HPC deployment.  
  - Achieved **0.74 IoU** on unseen test data across **three segmentation classes (tumor, normal, background)**.  
  - Demonstrated a scalable approach with potential to aid **real-time intraoperative margin detection**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology  

- **Data Source:** Hyperspectral imaging data of HNSCC surgical specimens, collected at Emory University Hospital.  
- **Preprocessing:**    
  - Image patches extracted (24√ó24√ó91 spectral bands).  
  - Standardization + spectral band normalization.  

- **Model:** Wavelet CNN  
  - Combines **wavelet transforms** (spectral features) + **2D CNN layers** (spatial features).  
  - Dense connections, Haar wavelets, and channel-wise concatenation for efficient feature extraction.  
  - Trained on **NVIDIA Titan-XP GPUs** with Adam optimizer and early stopping.  

- **Evaluation Metric:** Intersection over Union (IoU).

## üìä Results  

| Experiment                     | IoU Score | Notes |
|--------------------------------|-----------|-------|
| Wavelet CNN + Factor Analysis   | **0.48**  | Faster training but poor separation (loss of spectral info). |
| Wavelet CNN (full spectral)     | **0.59**  | Improved separation between tumor vs. normal. |
| Optimized Wavelet CNN (HPC run) | **0.74**  | Strongest results on unseen test specimens. |  

**Key Insight:** Preserving all **91 spectral bands** leads to better feature extraction and segmentation accuracy compared to dimensionality reduction.  

**Note:** Segmentation images are restricted and not available for public display, in accordance with the policies of the Quantitative Bioimaging Lab (QBIL). These restrictions are in place due to research data privacy and ethical guidelines, as the images originate from specialized biomedical datasets that require controlled access.

## üìå Future Work  

- Expand dataset to include more surgical specimens for better generalization.  
- Explore hybrid architectures (e.g., ResNet + Wavelet CNN).  
- Investigate real-time integration for **intraoperative margin detection**.
